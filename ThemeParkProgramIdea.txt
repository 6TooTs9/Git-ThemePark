Theme Park Management Program

What the user should/would want to see
-General overview of the park that corresponds to the current day and time
 ( relevant wait times for rides, shows, restaurants, park schedule/hours, other relevant info)

-Should be able to specify an area of the park that they would want to look at
and delve deeper from there

-possibly make a reservation or even order tickets by using the program
( for this especially, the user should be able to store this info either 
via some type of personal account or something)
